!PCI bus mb1 (Slots 1, 3 and 5) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.
!Current configuration on bus mb1 has a total of 600 bandwidth points. 
!This configuration is within the PCI bus capacity and is supported. 
!
!PCI bus mb2 (Slots 2, 4 and 6) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.
!Current configuration on bus mb2 has a total of 690 bandwidth points.
!The set of PA-2FE, PA-POS-2OC3, and I/O-2FE qualify for "half 
!bandwidth points" consideration, when full bandwidth point counting 
!results in oversubscription, under the condition that only one of the 
!two ports is used. With this adjustment, current configuration on bus 
!mb2 has a total of 690 bandwidth points. 
!This configuration has oversubscripted the PCI bus and is not a 
!supported configuration. 
!
!Please refer to the following document "Cisco 7200 Series Port Adaptor
!Hardware Configuration Guidelines" on Cisco.com <http://www.cisco.com>
!for c7200 bandwidth points oversubscription and usage guidelines.
