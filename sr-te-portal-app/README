This is a generated python OPM package, made by:

 wae-make-package --python-opm-skeleton lsp-optm-rsvp

It contains a sample Yang model and the implementation for a skeleton python
OPM package invoked through an action point. They serve as an example to get
you going.

- In package-meta-data.xml, the <name> is the module name.

- The python classes executed by the module exist in python/opmSkeleton.py and
  are named OpmSkeleton and OpmSkeletonAction. If the python file or classes
  are renamed, the <python-class-name> in package-meta-data.xml needs to be
  updated to replace opmSkeleton.OpmSkeleton with the new name.

- The action point triggered by this sample module is called
  opm-skeleton-action-point and is present in the Yang model.

  To rename the action point, an update is needed to python/opmSkeleton.py
  and src/lsp-optm-rsvp.yang files.

- In this package,

    The OpmSkeleton class implements the registration of the action point.

    The OpmSkeletonAction class, derived from OpmActionBase, implements a
    skeleton python OPM package which:
    - Takes as inputs a boolean flag and string value.
    - Copies them over to output attributes, a boolean result and a string
      message.

The included src/Makefile can be used to compile the Yang model and build the
fxs file, or you can use the --build option of wae-make-package.
